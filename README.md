# quantium-VE

Repository for the Qantium Data Analytics experience program.

### Task 1

Task 1 involved cleaning up large data sets n different file formats which had incosistencies, incomplete data and incompatible data formats.

> - High level validation checks on the rogue data sets
> - Extracting different metrics and producing basic visualisations

### Task 2

After cleaning the data set looked at quantifying the impact of sales strategies.

> - Used hypothesis tests and regression analysis to build a predictive uplift model
> - Used the model to compare with the real world data and quantify any measurable impacts

With all the data and visualisations extracted, put together a short presentation that gives a top line overview of the main takeaways.
